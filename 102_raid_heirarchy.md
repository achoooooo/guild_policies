# 102. Raid Heirarchy

Juicy uses a two-tier approach to its raid team: Core raiders and Flex raiders. Before describing each of these, it's important to discuss the problems with standard raid teams and how we'll solve them with this approach.

Problems with a typical raid team:
    - Low stability: there are exactly as many "core" members as required, so unless a "bench" system is set up any absence results in missing players.
    - A typical "bench" system only allows for players to play if somebody is absent. But if our team is as good as we want it to be, that may not ever happen!
    - There's no process for players who can only play *sometimes* to join the raid, they just have to hope it works out.

Prioirty to join the raid group should be given to:
    1. Core raiders who signed up
    2. Flex raiders who signed up
    3. Core raiders who didn't sign up
    4. Flex raiders who didn't sign up

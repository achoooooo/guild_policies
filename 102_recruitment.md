# 102. Recruitment

Guild recruiting is important. The key to good recruitment is to understand what kind of player we're looking for, and from there we can develop a full recruitment strategy. So, who are we looking for?

## The Ideal <Juicy> Guildie

Let's imagine an imaginary player who is the perfect recruit, exactly the kind of person we want. Let's call this person `Bill`. Most people aren't exactly like `Bill`, and all of us could be a little more like `Bill`. 

What is Bill like?

- Bill loves to play WoW, and recognizes that it's just a game.
- Bill is a `trysoft` - he tries, but he's not a tryhard.
- Bill enjoys playing with friends, and is happy to attend public events to help the team.
- Bill has a great sense of humor and isn't turned off by Sneeze's lame jokes.
- Bill also happens to pump and is excellent at whatever role he plays.
- Bill is a humble raider, and during progression learns from occasional constructive criticism, as long as it's reasonable and not a personal dig.
- Bill never resorts to personal attacks on one's character, and is accepting of every guildie.
- `Bill fucks.`

Let's also imagine another player who we do NOT want, an imaginary player named `Jordan`. We don't want to recruit any `Jordan`s, as their personalities clash with what we're trying to accomplish.

What is Jordan like?

- Jordan is a sweaty tryhard who gets upset when the guild hasn't met his idea of success.
- Jordan is toxic on chat, frequently resorts to personal attacks, and speaks poorly of other guildies behind their back.
- Jordan is a slacker who hardly ever shows up to raid, and puts zero effort into improving his raid knowledge & performance.
- Jordan is a person who constantly begs for help from other guildies, but is almost never willing to help.
- Jordan does not respond well to constructive feedback and is never willing to change his gameplay to help the raid.
- Jordan is easily offended and frequently gets angry at other guildies during social events.
- Jordan does not cry at the end of the Iron Giant because he a stupid, soulless FUCK.
- `Jordan does not fuck.`

## Making A Good Recruit Message

Now that we know *who* would make a good recruit, how does that affect the way we recruit? As seen above by our ideal recruit `Bill`, we're looking for more casual raiders who are great players and always down for a good time. To recruit such a player, it's important that our guild recruit messages make an impression that somebody like Bill would like.

Keeping this in mind, you should keep the following things in mind when writing guild recruit messages:

    1. Guild recruit messages should often include a lighthearted joke that Bill would like.
    2. Guild recruit messages should stand out and be memorable for memers like Bill.
    3. Guild messages should contain enough information so Bill knows:
        - <Juicy> is a guild that's recruiting.
        - We are a raiding guild focused on having fun and building a good community.
        - Bill fucks, and Jordan does not.
    4. Guild messages should stray away from being too serious and cringe.

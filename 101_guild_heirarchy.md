# 101. Guild Heirarchy

Juicy has a bit of a different type of guild structure. Below in detail we'll describe our guilds unique structure, as well as some motivation on why it was created in this manner. A quick terminology distinction: the set of class 2 Leads are simply referred to as "Leads", and all three classes in the heirarchy defined here are referred to as "the leadership team". So below references to the "leadership team" are meant to include Officers and Class Representatives as well.

# Motivation

TODO: Motivation - why not just officers?

# The Three Overlapping Leadership Classes

## Class 1: Officers

Officers are the highest level decision makers in the guild. They exist to have the final say on guild decisions, but can (and should) gather opinions for the guild's trusted council, such as the rest of the guild's leadership team, to make quality decisions. Unlike other guilds, the Juicy team of officers is meant to be *small*. This is done on purpose to allow the guild to be more flexible and focused in their decision-making.

### Officer Qualification

As officers represent the highest tier

- Who gets to be officer?
    - As explained below, that is up to the sole discretion of the GM.
    - The expectation is that members of the Class 2 Lead team are first in line to be selected as they represent the guild's most trusted members.
- How many officers are there?
    - This is also exclusively up to the GM, but as explained above in the `Motivation` section, this number is meant to be kept relatively small.

### Officer Responsibilities

TODO: responsibilities of all officers

Some points to consider

### The Guild Master

All officers are expected to cooperatively execute the duties defined above. However, exactly one officer should also be the designated Guild Master (GM). The Guild Master shares all the same officer responsibilities defined above, but has the following additional responsibilities:

1. The GM must have an in-game character designated as guild master, and is therefore responsible for executing ingame responsibilities unique to the GM as such. This includes tabard management, in-game guild role management, and more.
    1. It's important to note that the *decisions* behind such changes should be weighed on by all officers, but the *execution* of such changes can be done only by the in-game GM, as this is a restriction of the game itself.
    1. The GM is expected to execute these abilities faithfully, and in a way that is agreed upon by other officers.
1. The GM should represent the guild in communication channels that require an "official" representative from our guild's leadership.
1. The GM is responsible for adding and removing other officers, and is expected to do so in a way that is not unreasonable and in agreement with other officers.

Some extra points to consider:

- If the GM wishes to step down, it's recommended they select an existing officer to take their place. A new officer should be added to make up for this new opening.
- If a majority of the leadership team is unanimously unhappy with the current GM, the GM is expected to heed their feedback and either implement their changes, or step down.

# 101. Guild Heirarchy

Juicy has a slightly unique guild structure. Below we'll describe our guilds structure in detail, as
well as some motivation on why it was created in this manner. A quick terminology distinction: the
set of class 2 Leads are simply referred to as "Leads", and all three classes in the heirarchy
defined here are referred to as "the leadership team". So below references to the "leadership team"
are meant to include Officers and Class Representatives as well.

# The Three Juicy Leaders

Juicy's leadership team is split into three major classes: **Officers**, **Leads**, and **Class
Representatives**. It's important to note that these three classes are technically *mutually
exclusive*, meaning it's possible for someone (like Bill) to be all three at the same time. That
being said, a single player cannot be two types of leads, or a representative of two classes. That's
because it defeats the purpose of these roles, which is to be highly specialized expert a single
domain.

## Class 1: Officers

Officers are the highest level decision makers in the guild. They exist to have the final say on
guild decisions, but can (and should) gather opinions for the guild's trusted council, such as the
rest of the guild's leadership team, to make quality decisions.

### Officer Eligibility

Additional Officers are added and removed at the sole discretion of the GM, who themselves is an
officer. It's expected that Leads who are doing a great job should be first in line to become
officers, as they should represent the guild's most trusted and responsible members. The number of
officers is also up to the discretion of the GM, but should be kept low for reasons explained in
`Sneeze's Juicy Manifesto` on the main page.

### Officer Responsibilities

All officers have the following responsibilities:

1. Have the final say on major guild decisions
   - When possible, decisions can and should be left to the associated Lead. This is especially
   applicable for smaller, or domain-specific decisions.
   - It should be common for officers to ask the rest of the leadership team for input, but the
   final choice is left to the Officer team.
1. Create and remove positions from the leadership team.
1. Add and remove leads.

### The Guild Master

All officers are expected to cooperatively execute the duties defined above. However, exactly one
officer should also be the designated Guild Master (GM). The Guild Master shares all the same
officer responsibilities defined above, but has the following additional responsibilities:

1. The GM must have an in-game character designated as guild master, and is therefore responsible
for executing ingame responsibilities unique to the GM as such. This includes tabard management,
in-game guild role management, and more.
   - It's important to note that the *decisions* behind such changes should be weighed on by all
   officers, but the *execution* of such changes can be done only by the in-game GM, as this is a
   restriction of the game itself.
   - The GM is expected to execute these abilities faithfully, and in a way that is agreed upon by
   other officers.
1. The GM should represent the guild in communication channels that require an "official"
representative from our guild's leadership.
1. The GM is responsible for adding and removing other officers, and is expected to do so in a way
that is not unreasonable and in agreement with other officers.
1. The GM is responsible for deciding on guild structure and, if desired, spending an obscene amount
of time writing detailed policy documents.

Some extra points to consider:

- If the GM wishes to step down, it's recommended they select an existing officer to take their
place. A new officer should be added to make up for this new opening.
- If a majority of the leadership team is unanimously unhappy with the current GM, the GM is
expected to heed their feedback and either implement their changes, or step down.

## Class 2: Leads

Leads, like officers, are among the most trusted members of the guild. In many other guilds people
with this level of responsibility would be considered officers as well. In Juicy they're given a
separate distinction, read `Sneeze's Juicy Manifesto` to learn why.

These are the current types of leads, which is subject to change:

* Recruitment lead
* Raid lead
* Raid strategist
* Loot master
* Guild bank
* Event lead

### Lead Eligibility

Any player in the guild can apply to be a lead above by using an application link in Discord. We
expect leads to not only follow all guild rules, but also be reliable role-model players. Preference
will be given to players who are well-established in the guild already.

In your application to become a lead, you'll be asked about any prior experience and your vision for
the lead role you've selected. We wanted this to be broad to give you the opportunity to let us know
what could be changed. It's possible that the officers will follow up to chat about your app in
further detail.

We realize that having to go through all these hoops might be a little annoying, and
[we're sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHMD5N-KPw) for that. But one benefit of this
structure is that we plan to always be accepting applications, not just at the start. This means
that at any time, anyone could be replaced as a Lead. This allows for talented new recruits to
always be on the radar for a potential leadership role and have an opportunity for advancement. It
also means Leads can't get comfortable, and have to consistently show their value to officers in
order to not be replaced.

### Shared Responsibilities

As one of the guild's most respected ranks, Leads are expected to have a lot in common with our
guild's ideal recruit, `Bill`. Leads are also expected to do the following:

1. Be knowledgeable in their selected focus area and assume its associated jobs.
1. Meet on occasion with the officers to discuss guild issues and planning.
1. Be responsible rule-following players.
1. In some cases, and at their discretion, Leads will be expected to manage a small team of
assistants to perform their duties.

Below we'll discuss the role of each lead in detail.

### Recruitment lead

Recruitment is probably the single most important job in the entire guild. Without recruitment, our
community dies out, our raid misses out on new talent, and our presence on the realm diminishes. As
a recruitment lead, you'd be helping promote Juicy's public profile and get the word out to recruit
as many talented players to the guild as possible.

More specifically, the recruitment lead is responsible for:

- Promoting the guild both ingame and out-of-game by creating recruitment messages on relevant
social messages, and reusable messages that can be posted by guildies ingame.
- Assembling and managing a small team of helpers who will work with you to recruit ingame.
- Provide feedback on ways to improve the recruitment-onboarding experience.
- Report feedback from new recruits to the leadership team and use the information given to help
us improve the guild.
- Work with other leads, such as the raid lead and raid strategist, to know what classes we're
looking to recruit to improve our recruitment messages.

### Raid lead

The raid lead, next to the raid strategist, is an important piece of our raid's leadership. The
raid lead is responsible for executing the plan laid out by the raid strategist. Unlike the raid
strategist, this is a highly visible and very vocal position where you'll be leading our team on
the night of raid.

The raid lead should:

- Be present at raid every. single. week.
- Be the real-time shot-caller in raid by instructing each member in the raid what to do and where
to go.
- Work with the raid strategist outside of raid to understand and help refine our raid's plan.

### Raid strategist

The raid strategist, just like the raid lead, is responsible for helping our raids run smoothly.
Unlike the raid lead, the raid strategist is not as highly visible. The raid strategist takes a
step back from night-of shot calling and focuses instead on studying logs, strategies and team
compositions. They use this information to craft a plan, which is executed on the night of by
the raid lead.

The raid strategist should:

- Be incredibly knowledgable of TBC content and keep up to date on popular strategies to complete
raid content to the best of our ability.
- Work together with the raid lead to refine a complete raid strategy.
- Be the raid's go-to contact for any suggestions to improve raid stability.
- Work with the rest of the leadership team to fill gaps that affect raid performance.

### Loot master

The loot master is responsible on the night of raid for receiving all loot and managing a system
to ensure the correct person gets each item. This has a lot to do with Juicy's loot system which,
at the time of writing, has not yet been defined fully. We do know, though, that we will **not
be using a loot council** and will very likely be using points.

The loot master should:

- Be present at almost every raid.
- Have a system to track and distribute items via a yet-to-be-established points system.
- Handle potential loot-disputes in a way that's well-tempered.
- Be responsible and never ninja loot.

### Guild bank

The guild banker is responsible for storing guild items and distributing them to the correct parties.
By having control of most of the guild's resources, the guild banker must clearly be an extremely
trustworthy member of the guild.

The guild banker should:

- Be highly available to organize, collect and distribute guild items to the parties who need them.
- Be knowledgable of inventories and collection goals to understand what our guild needs more of,
and what we have plenty of.
- Help assemble programs to allow players to contribute items to the guild bank, and help the
leadership organize reward programs for doing so. 

### Event lead

The evet lead is responsible for all non-raid events. Basically, they exist to make sure our guild is
doing things together outside of raid, such as public small-scale raids, movie nights, PvP nights
and more.

The event lead should:

- Work with officers to get permission to set up events on our Discord.
- Be knowledgable of what kinds of events our guild would like to do together, and be proactive in
organizing and leading such events.

## Class 3: Class Representative

Class Representatives are members of a certain class that we feel are knowledgeable and
approachable. They're meant to be mentors, and are designated as a guild resource so new members
(and officers/leads) can ping for advice on playing better. It's possible that for some classes we
may have multiple class representatives (ie. Druid) with different focus areas.

I'll write more about Class Reps later, for the time being we aren't yet actively looking for any!

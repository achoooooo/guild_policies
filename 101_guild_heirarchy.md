# 101. Guild Heirarchy

Juicy has a slightly unique guild structure. Below we'll describe our guilds structure in detail, as
well as some motivation on why it was created in this manner. A quick terminology distinction: the
set of class 2 Leads are simply referred to as "Leads", and all three classes in the heirarchy
defined here are referred to as "the leadership team". So below references to the "leadership team"
are meant to include Officers and Class Representatives as well.

# Sneeze's Juicy Manifesto

There are a couple of major problems I wanted the guild structure to address:

1. "Class leads" being automatic officers is a flawed concept
   - If someone plays a class well, that's great. But playing a certain class has little to do
   with one's ability to be a good leader and officer.
   - What happens if you have no responsible player that plays a certain class? You are faced with
   an impossible choice of promoting a bad player to the guild's most respected role, or having a
   missing leadership spot.
   - What if you have two really great players that play the same class? Then you have at least
   one great player who never gets to become a recognized officer, because there is simply no
   avenue for them to do so.
1. Having too many "officers" makes it difficult to make big decisions
   - This is a huge and likely controversial point. In short: I believe there are certain
   situations where it's better to have fewer people making decisions, rather than more. 
   - This definitely exeplifies the concept of "too many cooks in the kitchen", it can be
   paralyzing to a guild to have officers arguing forever over the final say.
   - Of course, that's not to say that most decisions need more that just a few people deciding.
   But there needs to be some mechanic in order to give a smaller number of people the ability to
   reach a consensus.
   - The guild should have enough officers as necessary to make informed and balanced decisions,
   but few enough such that agreements can be easily reached and with a clear direction.
   - Starting off with fewer members of leadership is also never a bad idea due to a very simple
   premise: it's much easier to add someone to the leadership team than it is to remove them.

So, what's the solution? Instead of having a leadership that's centralized around your class, it
should be centralized around *jobs*. Guilds have done this already by making certain people "raid
lead", "loot master", and more. But as seen above, we feel it's more flexible if the number of
people making guildwide decisions is not directly tied to the number of people helping perform these
jobs. This way adding and removing these jobs is much easier.

# The Three Juicy Leaders

Juicy's leadership team is split into three major classes: **Officers**, **Leads**, and **Class
Representatives**. It's important to note that these three classes are technically *mutually
exclusive*, meaning it's possible for someone (like Bill) to be all three at the same time. That
being said, a single player cannot be two types of leads, or a representative of two classes. That's
because it defats the purpose of these roles, which is to be highly specialized expert a single
domain.

## Class 1: Officers

Officers are the highest level decision makers in the guild. They exist to have the final say on
guild decisions, but can (and should) gather opinions for the guild's trusted council, such as the
rest of the guild's leadership team, to make quality decisions.

### Officer Eligibility

Additional Officers are added and removed at the sole discretion of the GM, who themselves is an
officer. It's expected that Leads who are doing a great job should be first in line to become
officers, as they should represent the guild's most trusted and responsible members. The number of
officers is also up to the discretion of the GM, but should be kept low for reasons explained above
in `Sneeze's Juicy Manifesto`.

### Officer Responsibilities

All officers have the following responsibilities:

1. Have the final say on major guild decisions
   - When possible, decisions can and should be left to the associated Lead. This is especially
   applicable for smaller, or domain-specific decisions.
   - It should be common for officers to ask the rest of the leadership team for input, but the
   final choice is left to the Officer team.
1. Create and remove positions from the leadership team.
1. Add and remove leads.

### The Guild Master

All officers are expected to cooperatively execute the duties defined above. However, exactly one
officer should also be the designated Guild Master (GM). The Guild Master shares all the same
officer responsibilities defined above, but has the following additional responsibilities:

1. The GM must have an in-game character designated as guild master, and is therefore responsible
for executing ingame responsibilities unique to the GM as such. This includes tabard management,
in-game guild role management, and more.
   - It's important to note that the *decisions* behind such changes should be weighed on by all
   officers, but the *execution* of such changes can be done only by the in-game GM, as this is a
   restriction of the game itself.
   - The GM is expected to execute these abilities faithfully, and in a way that is agreed upon by
   other officers.
1. The GM should represent the guild in communication channels that require an "official"
representative from our guild's leadership.
1. The GM is responsible for adding and removing other officers, and is expected to do so in a way
that is not unreasonable and in agreement with other officers.
1. The GM is responsible for deciding on guild structure and, if desired, spending an obscene amount
of time writing detailed policy documents.

Some extra points to consider:

- If the GM wishes to step down, it's recommended they select an existing officer to take their
place. A new officer should be added to make up for this new opening.
- If a majority of the leadership team is unanimously unhappy with the current GM, the GM is
expected to heed their feedback and either implement their changes, or step down.

## Class 2: Leads

Leads, like officers, are among the most trusted members of the guild. In many other guilds people
with this level of responsibility would be considered officers as well. In Juicy they're given a
separate distinction, read `Sneeze's Juicy Manifesto` to learn why.

These are the current types of leads, which is subject to change:

* Recruitment lead
* Raid lead
* Raid strategist
* Loot master
* Guild bank
* Event lead

### Lead Eligibility

Any player in the guild can apply to be a lead above by using an application link in Discord. We
expect leads to not only follow all guild rules, but also be reliable role-model players. Preference
will be given to players who are well-established in the guild already.

In your application to become a lead, you'll be asked about any prior experience and your vision for
the lead role you've selected. We wanted this to be broad to give you the opportunity to let us know
what could be changed. It's possible that the officers will follow up to chat about your app in
further detail.

We realize that having to go through all these hoops might be a little annoying, and
[we're sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHMD5N-KPw) for that. But one benefit of this
structure is that we plan to always be accepting applications, not just at the start. This means
that at any time, anyone could be replaced as a Lead. This allows for talented new recruits to
always be on the radar for a potential leadership role and have an opportunity for advancement. It
also means Leads can't get comfortable, and have to consistently show their value to officers in
order to not be replaced.

### Shared Responsibilities

Leads are expected to have a lot in common with our guild's ideal recruit, `Bill`, and strive to be
more like `Bill` every day.

The Raid Lead is one of our two leads focused on running a smooth and organized raid.

#### Test

## Class 3: Class Representative

Class Representatives are members of a certain class that we feel are knowledgeable and
approachable. They're meant to be mentors, and are designated as a guild resource so new members
(and officers/leads) can ping for advice on playing better. It's possible that for some classes we
may have multiple class representatives (ie. Druid) with different focus areas.

I'll write more about Class Reps later, for the time being we aren't yet actively looking for any!

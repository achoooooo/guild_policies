# Sneeze's Juicy Manifesto

There are a couple of major problems I wanted the guild structure to address:

1. "Class leads" being automatic officers is a flawed concept
   - If someone plays a class well, that's great. But playing a certain class has little to do
   with one's ability to be a good leader and officer.
   - What happens if you have no responsible player that plays a certain class? You are faced with
   an impossible choice of promoting a bad player to the guild's most respected role, or having a
   missing leadership spot.
   - What if you have two really great players that play the same class? Then you have at least
   one great player who never gets to become a recognized officer, because there is simply no
   avenue for them to do so.
1. Having too many "officers" makes it difficult to make big decisions
   - This is a huge and likely controversial point. In short: I believe there are certain
   situations where it's better to have fewer people making decisions, rather than more. 
   - This definitely exeplifies the concept of "too many cooks in the kitchen", it can be
   paralyzing to a guild to have officers arguing forever over the final say.
   - Of course, that's not to say that most decisions need more that just a few people deciding.
   But there needs to be some mechanic in order to give a smaller number of people the ability to
   reach a consensus.
   - The guild should have enough officers as necessary to make informed and balanced decisions,
   but few enough such that agreements can be easily reached and with a clear direction.
   - Starting off with fewer members of leadership is also never a bad idea due to a very simple
   premise: it's much easier to add someone to the leadership team than it is to remove them.

So, what's the solution? Instead of having a leadership that's centralized around your class, it
should be centralized around *jobs*. Guilds have done this already by making certain people "raid
lead", "loot master", and more. But as seen above, we feel it's more flexible if the number of
people making guildwide decisions is not directly tied to the number of people helping perform these
jobs. This way adding and removing these jobs is much easier.
